[^1]: **Disclaimer**: I do AoC for fun and to learn new languages. Part of my learning process (also for fun, even if I
know the language already), is to check what other users do and learn a few tricks from it. I can't help but incorporate
their cool, clean, concise pieces into my code. Sometimes their code is so much better than mine that I replace the
whole thing. So I *do* come up with answers on my own, but I can't claim being the author of anything you see here since
I'm not tracking what is mine and what I incorporated. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç

# Custom Tailored Functions

In [2015, on day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/15) it was the first time we had to create separate functions for the test input and the actual input.

So far, we have tried to rely on the same code to process all the inputs. The following approach makes little sense in real-life development.
We can't test something on a piece of code that only serves the test itself and leave the "production code" to run untested.

So why did I do it like that? This answer can touch some interesting topics:

1. Rules are not the absolute truth, they are guidelines that should be followed all the time *unless* we have a *really strong* reason to break it, considering all the factors covered by the rule in question.
2. There is no production code here. *Everything* in AOC is a test, the only difference is:
   1. Part of it is a small set that is easier to debug and to compute, and for which we know the answer
   2. Part of it is our user input, which is harder to debug and compute, and for which the website will tell us if we got the right value (and we update our test accordingly)
3. The simpler solution consists of several loops depending on the input ingredients. The smaller set solution is just a regular `for`, while the larger set is processed by three nested `for`.

Could I make a generic solution that would process any number of ingredients present in the input? Yeah. But it could be harder to understand, take more time to implement, and since we won't process more than these two cases, creating a generic solution may be unnecessary.

So taking everything into consideration, I decided to split the code for different inputs. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
